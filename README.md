# Engage_Movierec

Hi this is my project for MS Engage Program 2022. THe code is split into backend and frontend. The backend includes the data
prcessing scripts and the backend includes the code to create the dashboard. 

One of the required files to run the dashboard was too large to be uploaded on to GitHub, so here is is the GDrive link to
download the file similarity.pkl. It should run normally once you add it to Engage_Movierec/FRONTEND.
